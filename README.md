# MLEnd-Hums-and-Whistles

Machine Learning classification pipeline on MLEnd Hums and Whistles Dataset.

A machine learning pipeline that takes all eight songs as input audio segment of hums and whistles of the song. Next it predicts its song label through a supervised learning approach.

This project deals with MLEnd Hums & Whistles Dataset, which can be found here. There are two solutions - simple and advanced. The simple solution deals with two categories from the dataset, i.e, Potter and StarWars audios. The advanced solution deals with multi class classification pipeline using different classification techniques and all the results are compared in detail. The main skills developed in this machine learning pipeline is cleaning, preprocessing and evaluating using the dataset.
